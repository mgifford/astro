Support for React Refresh

The React integration now fully supports React Refresh and is backed by `@vitejs/plugin-react`.

Also included in this change are new `include` and `exclude` config options. Use these if you want to use React alongside another JSX framework; include specifies files to be compiled for React and `exclude` does the opposite.
